In this repository, we will show you some codes that are all about OOP using inheritance, to present some of the codes from this semester

The first code is a simple calculator titled "Calculadora," featuring basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This code showcases how operations can be implemented in a class inherited from a parent class. User input is employed for entering numbers and selecting the desired operation.

The second code, "examen2," functions as a database for recording university sports and players. It allows tracking if a person plays on multiple teams. Inheritance is extensively utilized in this code, with two child classes inheriting from a parent class.

The third code, "Jugador," is a baseball team database that captures player statistics. Objects for each player are created with details such as name, nickname, jersey number, etc. This code explores concepts like overloaded, copy, and default constructors, as well as friend functions.

The fourth code, "carro," models a car's characteristics and behaviors. It demonstrates the use of classes and objects in C++ to represent a basic car concept, complete with methods for acceleration, braking, and obtaining information about the car.

The fifth and final code, "putnos," is designed for tracking points in an American football game. It allows users to input actions such as Touchdown, Extra Point, and Field Goal for two teams, displaying accumulated points after each action.

This final project covers various topics learned in this semester of advanced programming. We chose to emphasize the concept of inheritance as it involves more complex coding. We believe inheritance is fundamental in object-oriented programming, enhancing code reuse, aiding code organization and structuring, enabling polymorphism, and providing a foundation for efficient software extensibility and maintenance.
